# 🎉 Almost Done! Final Step

Your code has been successfully pushed to GitHub!

**Repository:** https://github.com/bittencourthenrique/figma-menu-screen

## ✅ Final Step: Enable GitHub Pages

2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")

3. Click **"Save"**

## ⏳ Wait for Deployment

After enabling GitHub Pages:
- Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
- You'll see a workflow called "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
- Wait 1-2 minutes for it to complete
- You'll see a green checkmark when done

## 🌐 Your Live Site

Once deployment completes, your prototype will be live at:

**https://bittencourthenrique.github.io/figma-menu-screen/**

You can also find this URL in:
- Repository → Settings → Pages
- Or in the Actions tab after deployment

## 🔄 Future Updates

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, your site will automatically update!
